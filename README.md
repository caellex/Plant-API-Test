A not so simple way to try out the Trefle API for my upcoming project.

1. Head over to https://trefle.io/ and register for an account. From there grab your API Key.

2. Head into main.js and plop your API key in on line 25. 

3. Run the server.mjs to open a CORS Proxy server, so you can fetch data from the Trefle API (CORS is not fun when you know nothing about it)

4. Start up a live server - And Voila, you have a massive plant database right at your fingertips.
